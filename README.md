# parsingJsonToCoreData

Importing JSON files into Coredata database. Each initial in the alphabet has its own entry to speedup the searching.

P.S. I thought that it would be faster to use Coredate other than read JSON files directly but it seems that it's better to 

just use JSON for a static database.
